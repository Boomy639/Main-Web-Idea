#  The Wave #

Original Idea:
// different themes while scrolling down with animations //

A lotta time and effort went into this Website, spanning over 2 years at this point.
real game changer to see what has become of it, and my skills as a web/software dev.

# Constant Ideas # 

Im constantly adding to this website when i get new ideas and when i finish new projects.
Currently this is the best i can do

# How I Got Here # 

I used a couple tutorials but most of the ideas are mine.
The elephant in the room is.... no i did not make the background animation that goes to Bárbara Rodríguez
